Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

1. You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

2. What if duplicates are allowed?  Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.
