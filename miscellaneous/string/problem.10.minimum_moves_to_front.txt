Given two strings A and B of the same length, in single turn you can choose any character from A and move it to the begining of the string A. Return the minimum turns needed to tranform A into B, if it's impossible, return -1.

EXAMPLES
"ABC"
"CBA"
Returns: 2

The optimal solution is to make two turns. On the first turn, choose character 'B' and obtain string "BAC". On the second turn, choose character 'C' and obtain "CBA".

"A"
"B"
Returns: -1
