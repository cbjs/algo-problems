Given a matrix with M rows and N columns (N x M). In each cell there's a number of
apples.
You start from the upper-left corner of the matrix. You can go down or right one
cell. You need to arrive to the bottom-right corner. Then you need to go back to
the upper-left cell by going each step one cell left or up. Having arrived at
this upper-left cell, you need to go again back to the bottom-right cell.
Find the maximum number of apples you can collect.
When you pass through a cell - you collect all the apples left there. 

Restrictions: 1 < N, M <= 50 ; each cell contains between 0 and 1000 apples
inclusive.
