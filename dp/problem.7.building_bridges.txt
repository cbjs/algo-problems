Consider a 2-D map with a horizontal river passing through its center. 
There are n cities on the southern bank with x-coordinates a(1) ... a(n) and n cities on the northern bank with x-coordinates b(1) ... b(n). 
You want to connect as many north-south pairs of cities as possible with bridges such that no two bridges cross. 
When connecting cities, you can only connect city i on the northern bank to city i on the southern bank. 
(Note: this problem was incorrectly stated on the paper copies of the handout given in recitation.)
