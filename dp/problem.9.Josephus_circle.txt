There are people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. 
The counting out begins at some point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction. 
In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed. 
The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), until only the last person remains, who is given freedom.

n个人(编号1..n)站成一个圈, 先把第m个人枪毙，然后从第m+1个人开始报数，枪毙第k个人，剩下的人继续从1报数, 枪毙第k个人直至剩下最后一个人。
求活下来的人的编号。

输入n, m, k。求最后活下来的人的编号。
