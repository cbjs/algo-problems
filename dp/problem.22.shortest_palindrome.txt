Given a string base that may or may not be a palindrome, we can always force base to be a palindrome by adding letters to it. For example, given the word "RACE", we could add the letters "CAR" to its back to get "RACECAR". we could also add the letters "ECA" to the front to get "ECARACE". 

Your task is to make base into a palindrome by adding as few letters as possible and return the resulting string.  When there is more than one palindrome of minimal length that can be made, return the lexicographically earliest.
